Picfinity

Picfinity is a 500px client for Windows 8. More details on it available here
http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-in/app/picfinity/33ba9249-a9f4-44df-973c-21962376c3ea

This repository has the latest code of the application.

Edit: <del>You might not find the application in the store if you are a new user, as my developer account is temporarily 
down and since apps under that would not be displayed to new users of the application</del> It is back in store!
